This instructions explain how to make an image for your single board computer.

Firstly burn an SD card with your board's default OS (It is recommanded to use the command line version).

(raspian lite for raspberry users)



Connect keyboard and screen to your board and boot it up and do the following:
Login as root using:

sudo su
(and set a new password using passwd)


Now enter:

systemctl start ssh
systemctl enable ssh
(For systemd only)

It is recommanded that hawk will use the root user rather then a regular user so 
edit (using vi or nano) the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add the following line:

PermitRootLogin yes

now reboot

change address using:

hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>

(optional)
deleted the previous user and uneeded groups with 

deluser <user>
delgroup <group>


Make sure your board has an internet connection you may disconnect the screen and the keyboard and use ssh if you wish:
ssh root@address
If you choose not to use root then login with the user you chose.

Now install the following for debian and ubuntu based systems:
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install zip unzip python3-dev python3-pip build-essential cmake pkg-config libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran git
pip3 install numpy

After that's done, you will need to compile the opencv library
wget -O opencv.zip https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.4.3.zip
unzip opencv.zip
cd opencv-3.4.3/
mkdir build
cd build

And compile with
cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -D BUILD_opencv_python3=ON ..
make -j <Number of cores>
make install
ldconfig

The more cores the faster the process but also the hotter you board will get.
I recommand using 2 cores for quadcores

(single core computer such as the rapberry zero will use thier single core)

After it is done you can delete the opencv.zip and opencv folder.

After you installed opencv install the following using pip3:
pip3 install pynetworktables
pip3 install robotpy-cscore

Now download the latest copy of hawk using
git clone https://gitlab.com/steampunk_software1577/hawk-vision.git
git pull

It is important to clone it to your home repository!

The next step is to make ~/hawk-vision/scripts/autostart.sh script to get started on boot.
An easy way to do it is to edit /etc/rc.local

/root/hawk-vision/scripts/autostart.sh &&
exit 0

#####NOTE#####
autostart assumes that the hawk user is root

if you choose a diffrent user refer to the script and change the /root with your user home

After that you are ready to go!
It highly recommanded to make an image file for your SD as a backup.
